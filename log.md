# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 2nd 2019

**Today's Progress**: Upgrade Rolo's React-Native from 0.57.1 to 0.59.3

**Thoughts** Holy crap I hope RN gets their act together on the upgrade process soon, it is painful! Manual file updates? Who wants to do that!

**Links to work** Private repo but you can see the number of commits in my profile
